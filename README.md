# **Jm's Big Dick into Tech Guide**
Some software engineering experience bundled into tiny lessons for some **BIG DICK** learning to be passed on to peers.

For the coding gods who may pass by here, please don't crucify me for any errors or inefficiencies in my code. I will shoot you. Instead, contribute to the repository and help people out with that big brain of yours :--)

### **DISCLAIMER**

This is information is made to be easy-to-digest with a more entrepreneurship-centric mindset/approach to getting to know Python. Any errors in wording may be present within this entire repository and though are free to be corrected, does not make the author(s) legally liable for any fuck ups you end up doing to yourself or your code.

## **Open to Collaborations**
I might even put this stuff into ITECH, but I'm leaving this out here for other people outside of BYTE and outside of my circle to get to know some stuff as well.

## **Contents**
1. **Python**

We need this shit for ITM. Basic lang 'to pramis just try to follow through with the resources and tips and tricks I lay out in this module. Good for data-heavy and small startups.

2. **Javascript**

Some vanilla javascript for browser, but mainly NodeJS for back-end and front-end development, a bit more complicated but very useful for startups as it enables fast and more or less easy apps to scale with.

3. **Java**

Am just putting this here for wayyy way in the future because I personally suck at it but I think Gabe wants to author this module so I'm leaving it here :--)

4. **Situational**

Some random lessons for specific situations where specific techniques and workflows will increase startup/development productivity.
