# **Setting Up Your Python Workspace**

Before getting to anything dirty on Python, we have to setup a clean environment so we don't screw everything up on our PATHs and shit.

## **Step 1: Download Python**

If you haven't downloaded Python already, start by downloading Python at this link below. Get the latest Python 3 BTW.

https://python.org

If you want a better IDE and a supported repository for more science-centric development, you might want to check Anaconda instead, which still uses Python 3, but lags behind Python's versions due to maintaining their own distribution.

## **Step 2: Download an IDE/Text Editor**

Personally, I like Visual Studio Code, but there are many other good choices you can integrate into your toolkit.

* Visual Studio Code
* ATOM
* Sublime Text

Okay anything outside of this would probably suck or be paid for, unless you can prove me wrong, then write an issue on the repo and tell me about it.

## **Step 3: For **EVERY** Project/Module, create a **NEW** Virtual Environment**

What is a virtual environment? Well, it's a way to manage packages to protect your projects from screwed up dependencies. 

For example, one of your projects requires *dependency version 1* but the other requires *dependency version 2*. Sadly installing *dependency* on your global environment would make it harder to work on both on separate times.

In order to prevent that, we make virtual environments to abstract package versioning and etc from each other to maintain projects. **Trust me, it's a worth-it inconvenience to get used to.**

## **Step 4: ???**

Just kidding you might want to start installing modules/packages at this point.**

## **Step 5: Profit!**

The fuck you waiting for? Go make some money. I mean programs. JK again, go to the next file to get to the next tip.
