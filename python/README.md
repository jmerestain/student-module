# **Python - KINDA noob Style**
Read this page or some shit to know where and when to use Python. **THIS IS NOT A REPOSITORY FOR TEACHING PYTHON. THERE'S WAY TOO MUCH SHIT ON THE INTERNET FOR ME TO DO THAT ALREADY**. Instead I'm showing some real-world examples and guides where Python may be used in a **startup environment**.

**Download Python here: https://python.org**

### **DISCLAIMER**

This is information is made to be easy-to-digest with a more entrepreneurship-centric mindset/approach to getting to know Python. Any errors in wording may be present within this entire repository and though are free to be corrected, does not make the author(s) legally liable for any fuck ups you end up doing to yourself or your code.

## **What is Python?**

Python is an interpreted strongly dynamically-typed programming language.

## **Where Should I Learn Python?**

The easiest way for myself ( JM ) to learn a programming language like Python is by example, so check this resource out:

https://www.learnbyexample.org/

## **What does 'interpreted language' mean?**
An intrepreted language usually makes use of an interpreter which means it does not need to compile to machine code on runtime to deploy its code. For your startup it means it'll probably be better for prototyping really fast but is prone to errors and slowdowns further down the road if you aren't mindful.

## **What does 'strongly-typed' mean?**
A strongly-typed language means that you cannot assign a data-type or value to a variable with a previously different assigned data-type on initalization.

## **What does 'dynamically-typed' mean?**
dynamically-typed means the variable types (like numbers and charaacters) are checked on runtime compared to statically-typed languages that check for types on compile time. There are a few more differences but you can check the article below out for more info:

## **Python's Advantages Within Startups**
* Code readability
* Extensible by high-performant C extensions
* Great use for AI/ML
* Easy to maintain
* Vast ecosystem for packages

## **When to Use Python Within Startups**
1. When you need to make readable code.
2. When you need a fast backend solution.
3. When you need to use AI/ML.
4. When you need to make a good CLI (Command Line Interface) to control and put together your tech stack - more on this later.
5. When you want to learn how to make embedded systems.
6. **When your startup isn't execution/speed centric**

## **Popular Packages for Startups on Python**
* Flask -  Web Microservice Framework
* Django - Batteries-included MVC Web Framework
* numpy - Complex data and math for Python
* pandas - Data Analysis Framework
* TensorFlow - Deep Learning Framework by Google
